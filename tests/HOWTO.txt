Testing IKBT

There are several ways to test the IKBT funcionality as a whole, and also unit tests of each piece.   

Unit tests:

To test all the leaves (solvers), (from this directory):

> cd ..  << you need to be in the project directory currently called IK-2, not /tests >>
> python -m tests.leavestest  << no ".py">>

to test the "helperfunctions":

> cd ..
> python -m tests.helpertest

HTML test report output:

"leavestest" can generate a nice HTML summary of the results using the package HTMLTestRunner.py by Wai Yip Tung.  to generate an html test report:


> cd .. 
> python -m tests.leavestest html

then open a new tab in your browser, hit <ctl>-O, and navigate to the project page and open the file "IK-BT_testreport.html".
(if nesc, customize projdir = '<dir>' in your leavestest.py file to place the file in the right place.)


Testing an individual leaf. 

If you are having trouble with a particular solver ("leaf"), you can test it individually:

> cd ..
> python -m ikbtleaves.sincos_solver  

(for the case of sincos solver for example). 


Testing ik_classes.py
  This file has not been integrated with unittest yet.  To test: 
  
> cd ..
> python -m ikbtbasics.ik_classes
